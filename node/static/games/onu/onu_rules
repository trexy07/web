<h1>
    ONU Rules
</h1>


<h2>
    Setup
</h2>

<p>
The deck is shuffled.
</p><p>
A player is then selected to have the role of Dealer.  If the game is a a New
Game, the Dealer is selected randomly.  If the game is a Play-Again Game, the
Dealer is the player to the left of the previous Dealer.  The Order of Play
starts with the player left of the Dealer, and continues clockwise.
</p><p>
Every player is dealt 1 card, face-down, in the order of play.  This process is
performed a total of 7 times.
</p><p>
Then, all players place aside any Wild-Draw-4 cards which they have in their
hand, and draw the same number of new cards from the deck.  This is repeated
until no players are in possession of any Wild-Draw-4 cards.  The Wild-Draw-4
cards which have been placed aside, if any, are then shuffled back into the
deck.
</p><p>
Finally, the dealer draws a card from the deck, and places it, regardless of its
type, color, or value.  Play then begins, starting to the left of the dealer and
continuing clockwise.
</p>



<h2>
    Gameplay
</h2>

<p>
The player to the left of the dealer starts play.  On their turn, every player
must, if able, play a card from their hand which matches the card on of the
discard pile (i.e., the card most recently played).  Cards match if one or more
of the following conditions is true:
<ul>
    <li>
        Both cards have the same color value
    </li><li>
        Both cards have the same numeric value (this condition cannot be met if
        either card does not have a numeric value)
    </li><li>
        Both cards have the same symbolic value (this condition cannot be met if
        either card does not have a symbolic value)
    </li>
</ul>
</p><p>
If, on their turn, a player is unable to play a card from their hand which
matches the card on the top of the discard pile, they must draw a single card.
If that card matches the top of the discard pile, they must play it.  If not,
their turn ends.
</p><p>
After a player plays a card such that it leaves them with exactly one card
remaining in their hand, (i.e., when they play their second-to-last card), they
gain the right to call ONU<sup><a id="ftn-1-ref" href="#ftn-1">[1]</a></sup>.
Upon calling ONU<sup><a id="ftn-2-ref" href="#ftn-2">[2]</a></sup>, a player
loses the right to call ONU<sup><a id="ftn-3-ref" href="#ftn-3">[3]</a></sup>
until they again play their second-to-last card.  If, while in possession of the
right to call ONU<sup><a id="ftn-4-ref" href="#ftn-4">[4]</a></sup>, a player
declines to call ONU<sup><a id="ftn-5-ref" href="#ftn-5">[5]</a></sup> before
their turn ends, other players gain the right to Call Out, targeting the
offending player.  The right to Call Out is lost if the targeted player calls
ONU<sup><a id="ftn-6-ref" href="#ftn-6">[6]</a></sup>, or if the targeted player
regains the right to call ONU by playing their second-to-last card.  When a
player chooses to use their right to Call Out, all players who have Call Out
rights which target the targeted player lose those Call Out rights, and the
targeted player loses ONU<sup><a id="ftn-7-ref" href="#ftn-7">[7]</a></sup>
rights.  The targeted player must also draw two cards.
</p>

<h2>
    Card Types
</h2>
<p>
Wild Cards do not have a number value associated with them, and as such do not
match with any other card by number.  If a player has a Wild Card in their hand
at the beginning of their turn, they may play it regardless of whether it
matches the card on the top of the discard pile.  Upon playing a Wild Card, a
player must assign a color value to it.
</p><p>
Skip Cards do not have a number value associated with them, and as such do not
match with any other card by number.  When a player plays a Skip Card, the turn
of the next player in the Order of Play is skipped.
</p><p>
Reverse Cards do not have a number value associated with them, and as such do
not match with any other card by number.  When a player plays a Reverse Card,
the Order of Play is reversed.  
</p><p>
Draw Cards do not have a number value associated with them, and as such do not
match with any other card by number.  When a player plays a Draw Card (a +2 or
+4 card), it creates an active Stack, using that card as the Top of the Stack,
and that Drawing Action Card's value as the Sum of the Stack.  If there is an
active Stack in play, then on their turn a player must add to the Stack.  To add
to the Stack, a player must play a Drawing Action Card with a value greater than
or equal to the value of the Drawing Action Card on the Top of the Stack.  This
Drawing Action Card is now the new Top of the Stack, and its value is added to
the Sum of the Stack.  If a player is unable to add to the Stack, the player
must draw the number of cards that is the Sum of the Stack, and the Stack is
deactivated.
